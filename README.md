#Exercises
## Exercise 1:
There is a review page design that i found from the following link "https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI/hub".
Seemed quite fun to me and yes it was funny for me to code.
## Exercise 2:
I found an example about array mutators. 
Basically, city name is added, added city names can be sorted, reverted, removed (partially or wholely) and the most difficult one mixed.
I used bootstrap to review a few topics, and javascript to maintain operations.
