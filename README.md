# Exercises

## Exercise 1
I stumbled upon this awesome review page design via a link: [Interactive Rating Component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI/hub). Working on it felt less like a chore and more like a journey filled with coding adventures.

## Exercise 2
I came across a fascinating example that involved playing around with array mutators. It wasn't just about adding city names; it was about sorting, reversing, or even mixing them up! It all began with a simple need to organize data, hence the name "sorting-arrays." Using Bootstrap for layout and JavaScript for functionality made the experience even more enjoyable.

## Exercise 3
I couldn't resist coding a rock-paper-scissors game exercise. Being a game enthusiast, bringing it to life was an absolute joy. I sprinkled it with style and added some cool functionalities using array properties, making it quite an engaging project. You can check out the exercise instructions [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

## Exercise 4
Today, I found myself without a specific exercise in mind, so I turned to Google for inspiration. What I ended up with was a classic temperature converter code. Adding my own touch of style to it was surprisingly satisfying.

## Exercise 5
Wanting to create something practical for others, I built a page visit counter. It keeps track of how many times a page is visited by storing visit data locally. Simple, yet quite handy!

## Exercise 6
Instead of just hunting for new exercises, I decided to invest my time in coding. So, I created a sleek digital clock. Implementing blinking columns using setInterval() was a fun challenge that I thoroughly enjoyed.

## Exercise 7
Feeling creative, I set out to create a fontawesome search page. Making it responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes was quite the puzzle, but I cracked it using media queries.

## Exercise 8
Delving into dynamic table manipulation, I crafted a tool that lets users add, update, or remove entries effortlessly. By combining HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript, I created a seamless interaction experience for users.

## Exercise 9
To enhance user experience, I designed an offcanvas privacy policy prompt positioned at the bottom of the page. Users can accept or reject the policy, with their actions being stored locally for legal purposes.

## Exercise 10
For a significant milestone, I developed a comprehensive weather application. Just input a city name, and voila! You get weather forecasts at your fingertips. It was quite fulfilling to see it come together.

## Exercise 11
Recognizing the importance of planning and organization, I created a user-friendly day planner. It integrates seamlessly with local storage, making it super convenient for users to plan their days effectively.

## Exercise 12
Inspired by a project called Etch-e Sketch from the Odin Project, I decided to give it a go. Its unique visual appeal made it a delightful project to work on.

## Exercise 13
Building on a similar project I did in Java, I created a visually captivating quiz game. And yes, there's a surprise waiting for you at the end when you complete the quiz and hit the "Cheers" button.

## Exercise 14
Amidst life's hustle and bustle, we all need some downtime. So, I came up with a boredom-busting app. Just generate a random activity or use advanced filters for tailor-made solutions. It's a great way to unwind!

## Exercise 15
I stumbled upon another free API and decided to put it to good use. This time, I incorporated more visuals, making it easier to find series and films. Plus, I implemented a technique to make searching smoother, which I believe would be quite helpful for websites.

## Exercise 16
Crafting a robust password generator was quite the challenge. Manipulating strings and ASCII values to create tough passwords required some serious tech finesse, but the end result was worth it.

## Exercise 17
Expanding on the concept of a to-do list, I created a notebook app for more comprehensive note-taking. With a reactive layout and data persistence through local storage, it's now easier to keep track of work and study details.

## Exercise 18
When a friend joked about getting old, I decided to prove them wrong by creating an age calculator. I added a touch of humor to the styling, indicating that age is just a number. Who knows, maybe I'll update the code when I hit that milestone myself!

## Exercise 20
Feeling inspired, I built a quote generator app. It offers motivational quotes from different authors or philosophers, perfect for uplifting spirits. And yes, you can share these quotes on social media too, spreading the positivity!
