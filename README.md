# Exercises
## Exercise 1:
There is a review page design that i found from the following link "https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI/hub".
Seemed quite fun to me and yes it was funny for me to code.
## Exercise 2:
I found an example about array mutators. 
Basically, city name is added, added city names can be sorted, reverted, removed (partially or wholely) and the most difficult one mixed. 
Whole story started with a need to sort data. Thus, name is sorting-arrays :)
I used bootstrap to review a few topics, and javascript to maintain operations.
## Exercise 3:
I have seen a rock paper scissors game exercise. I love games, so I just could not resist to code it. Ofc added lots of style and array properties to make it more advanced project. You can see the exercise instructions here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors
## Exercise 4:
Today I was out of exercise and searched on google for an exercise. Well here i have coded quintessential temperature convertor code. I really enjoy styling it.
## Exercise 5:
I decided to code something more useful for others as well. This is my page visit counter code. It counts how many times you have visited that page by storing your visits in local storage.
## Exercise 6:
After spending some time on checking for new exercise, i decided to code time instead of spending. So here I have a nice digital clock. It was fun to code blinking columns by using setInterval().
## Exercise 7:
I decided to create the fontawesome's search page. It is reactive and changes according to screen size. I used media query to do that.
## Exercise 8:
In this exercise, I created a dynamic table manipulation tool. You can add new entries by filling out the name and grade fields and clicking the "+ADD" button. Entries can be updated or removed by clicking the corresponding icons in each row. Thus users can add, update, or remove rows as well as cancel the opertaions from the table. I used HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript for this project. 
## Exercise 9: 
I created an offcanvas bottom of the page explaining to the user website's privacy policy. User can accept or reject the policy. If it is rejected or closed it will be off for 5 seconds and then reappear. Also User's action is stored in local storage to be used legally.
