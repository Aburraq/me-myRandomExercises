#Exercises
## Exercise 1:
There is a review page design that i found from the following link "https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI/hub".
Seemed quite fun to me and yes it was funny for me to code.
## Exercise 2:
I found an example about array mutators. 
Basically, city name is added, added city names can be sorted, reverted, removed (partially or wholely) and the most difficult one mixed. 
Whole story started with a need to sort data. Thus, name is sorting-arrays :)
I used bootstrap to review a few topics, and javascript to maintain operations.
