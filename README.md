# Exercises
## Exercise 1:
There is a review page design that i found from the following link "https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI/hub".
Seemed quite fun to me and yes it was funny for me to code.
## Exercise 2:
I found an example about array mutators. 
Basically, city name is added, added city names can be sorted, reverted, removed (partially or wholely) and the most difficult one mixed. 
Whole story started with a need to sort data. Thus, name is sorting-arrays :)
I used bootstrap to review a few topics, and javascript to maintain operations.
## Exercise 3:
I have seen a rock paper scissors game exercise. I love games, so I just could not resist to code it. Ofc added lots of style and array properties to make it more advanced project. You can see the exercise instructions here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors
## Exercise 4:
Today I was out of exercise and searched on google for an exercise. Well here i have coded quintessential temperature convertor code. I really enjoy styling it.
## Exercise 5:
I decided to code something more useful for others as well. This is my page visit counter code. It counts how many times you have visited that page by storing your visits in local storage.
## Exercise 6:
After spending some time on checking for new exercise, i decided to code time instead of spending. So here I have a nice digital clock. It was fun to code blinking columns by using setInterval().
## Exercise 7:
I decided to create the fontawesome's search page. It is reactive and changes according to screen size. I used media query to do that.
## Exercise 8:
In this exercise, I created a dynamic table manipulation tool. You can add new entries by filling out the name and grade fields and clicking the "+ADD" button. Entries can be updated or removed by clicking the corresponding icons in each row. Thus users can add, update, or remove rows as well as cancel the opertaions from the table. I used HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript for this project. 
## Exercise 9: 
I created an offcanvas bottom of the page explaining to the user website's privacy policy. User can accept or reject the policy. If it is rejected or closed it will be off for 5 seconds and then reappear. Also User's action is stored in local storage to be used legally. 
## Exercise 10:
It's number 10 so I coded a full weather app. Basically you can learn weather forecast with this app. Just write a name of a city and see the magic. 
## Exercise 11:
What is better than planning a day and saving it to local storage. So I decided to code it. Also, try to make it super user-friendly. Go check it out.
## Exercise 12:
I have seen a project called Etch-e Sketch in Odin Project. I decided to code it cuz it was way different from the projects that i googled. To be honest, I love this project cuz of its visual aspects.
## Exercise 13:
I did similar project on Java as well. Visually I was not satisfied with that one. Thus, here we go a brand new visually enjoying quiz game. I added a surprise in the end, you will see it when you complete quiz and press "Cheers" button.
## Exercise 14:
We all need to take a breathe in this busy life. However, it can be though to find an activity. So here we have bored app. Just generate a random activity or use advanced filter for tailor-made solutions. 
## Exercise 15:
Well I have found another free api, so I had to use it. This time i used more some photos to obtain from the api as well. Eventually, you can find every serie and film in this app only by writing its name. Also I used a technic that ease the population frequency in search input, which would be helpful for websites a lot.
## Exercise 16:
I coded a password generator by manipulating String and ASCII values. I worked on organizing characters efficiently using data structures and algorithms. It's like crafting a reliable tool for generating tough passwords, with a touch of tech savvy.
## Exercise 17:
I enjoyed coding to do list and decided to take it a step futther, and coded notebook app. I used flex wrap for reactive notes according to screen size, and saved the changes on local storage to retrieve saved notes whenever localhost is opened. Now i can add more details for my work as well as studies.
## Exercise 18:
A friend told me "We are getting old", and i decided to refute his argument by coding age calculator which calculates the age year, month and day basis. This code has some styling that indicates people below 65 are not old. In fact, above 65 is OK as well, probably I will amend the code when I am 65 :)
